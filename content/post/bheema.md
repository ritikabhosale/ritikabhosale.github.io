Recently I got to read this book - Bheema: The Lone Warrior written by M.T.Vasudevan. This book makes some interesting and shocking revelations that would want you to go back to the epic.

As the name suggests, this book is about Bheema, the second Pandava. Often when we ask people about their favourite character from Mahabharata, many of them answers Arjuna or Karna, a few will talk about Yudhishtir or Bheema, but someone would hardly say Bheema. I, myself would have said Karna until I read this book.

The author haven't changed the story, instead beautifully presented the whole story from Bheema's Perspective. When you see Mahabharata or hear about it, you would not think or see it from Bheema's perspective since he was not the most valued character. Through this book, you will not only see Bheema's real character but also the true characters of the other Pandvas and the two strong women, Kunti and Draupadi. 

Right from the childhood Bheema was treated differently. Whatever Arjuna did was always great but when Bheema did the same thing, all he got was just contempt from his brothers. When Arjuna killed first animal, everyone was happy and proud of him that they offered it to gods. But when Bheema killed a deer, no one praised him for his bravery. Bheema was as good a archer as Arjuna, he was even better at chariot fighting than Yudhistira, but Guru Dronacharya didn't allow him to go beyond his brothers in these sports.

This story also suggests some parts which we now differently. For instance, Hidimba and Baka whom everyone believe to be demon, are introduced as nishadas here. Bakasura was known to be a demon who demands a human each week, but the story tells that Baka collected men on behalf of the king who wanted to conduct the Purushamedha. And a surprising instance was Bheema getting to know the true identity of Karna during the war but still has to fight knowing that he is fighting with his elder brother.

This book also reveals the character of Draupadi. Draupadi, being the wife of all five pandvas only loved Arjuna. She was interested in Bheema only to hear his fights with kings and demons. This book also mentions Bheema's wives and his young sons who sacrificed their lives for the war. Not to forget the death of Ghatotkacha which was not more than a celebration in the Pandvas camp, which was really disheartening to see. 

This book is amazing. The incidences are presented beautifully by the author, and it raises brilliant ethical questions which will cause you to think. I loved this book and would highly recommend you to check it out.
