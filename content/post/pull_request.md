In this blog, we will see what is pull request and how do we use it.  

**What is Pull Request?**  
As the name suggests, pull request would be a request created to pull your code, which is right. You can create pull requests on github.

**When do you create pull request?**  
- A instance would be when you want to contribute your code, idea, feature, bug fix, or any sort of change, and you are not the contributer, then you fork the repository and make changes on your end and then create a fork request requesting the owner to pull your changes into their code. 

- Another instance would be when you work in teams on big projects. It depends on your team branching strategy, but generally you don't work and push directly on the main branch. You create a separate branch, work on it and then push changes on the same branch. So when you are done, you create a pull which suggests to merge your branch into main and delete your branch. 

**What can you add in a pull request?**  
So when you create a pull request, you can give appropriate title to it, you can add labels, reviewers. So the reviewers will review your code and to look if it satisfies the acceprance criteria, coding guidelines, or any other guideline that your team has decided. And if your code is satisfies the criteria then the reviewers will approve it else they can start a review and suggest changes that you need to make before the code can merge into main branch. 

So go ahead and start using pull requests to ensure your code is safe from any breaking changes.
