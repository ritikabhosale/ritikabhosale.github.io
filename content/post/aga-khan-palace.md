**History**

Aga Khan Palace was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan 3 in 1892 in Pune, Maharashtra. It's said that he built it to provide employment to the famine struct villages of the surrounding regions. He employed 1000 people and the palace was constructed in 5 years. The palace holds great importance. It served as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi, Kasturba Gandhi, Mahadev Desai and Sarojini Naidu. They were kept in the palace from 1942-44. Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai died died during this period and there samadhis are located in the palace. The ashes of Mahatma Gandhi are also located here with those of Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai.

**Beauty**

The palace covers an area of 19 acres, out of which 7 acres is built up area and the rest is well maintained garden, with spacious lawns, which mesmerizes its visitors. You could get really good photos clicked here. It is known for its brillant islamic Architecture. And it is one of the most popular tourist places in Pune.

**What's inside**
There are 5 halls in this palace with memorials of Gandhiji and their wife. The walls of these halls are filled with frames which has wide information about the Mahatma Gandhi and the freedom struggle movement. So if you are a history lover, then you would love this place.

**I want to share some points:-**

- This place is more of a museum than a palace.
- Carry cash with you for entry tickets. (You can also pay online, but it will comparatively take longer.)
- There is also a canteen backside.
